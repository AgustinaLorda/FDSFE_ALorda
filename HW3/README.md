What is this homework about? The homework is focused on performing a descriptive and exploratory analysis of the Happiness dataset. I worked on hypothesis testing  using the KS test. 
Who did you work with? Myself 
Did you lead any of the work in your group? what were your specific contributions (if you were not ready to lead any aspect that is perfectly ok, just state so! but you and your group mates should have consistent statements): I worked by myself
