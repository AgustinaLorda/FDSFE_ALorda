What is this homework about? In my homework on logistic regression, I evaluated a direct marketing campaign by a Portuguese banking institution, using a dataset with client demographics and campaign interactions to predict term deposit subscriptions. I learned to preprocess data by normalizing features and encoding categorical variables. I implemented logistic regression, fitted the model, and generated predictions. Additionally, I created visualizations using Seaborn to understand the model's predictions better. This experience enhanced my practical skills in applying logistic regression and evaluating models in marketing analytics.
Who did you work with? I worked by myself
