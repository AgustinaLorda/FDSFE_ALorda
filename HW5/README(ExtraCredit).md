What is this homework about? In this extra credit assignment, I created regression models to analyze real estate valuations in Sindian District, New Taipei City. I first built a simple regression model using the log10 of the distance to the nearest MRT station to predict house prices per unit area, calculating key metrics like 𝑅² and adjusted 𝑅². Then, I developed a multiple regression model that included all features, such as transaction date and house age, to further explore their impacts on house prices. This experience helped me understanding how to construct and evaluate regression models.
Who did you work with? I worked mainly by myself but received some help from Adeoluwa Afolabi
